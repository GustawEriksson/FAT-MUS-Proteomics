## Introduction
This proteomics analysis pipeline is based on the 'DEP: Differential Enrichment analysis of Proteomics data' package by Arne Smits and used for E Stener Victorin _et al._ (2023) MedRxiv (Revision). It was implemented to investigate differentially expressed proteins and phosphorylation sites from tandem mass spectrometry of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle from women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in PCOS women after 5 weeks of treatment with electrical stimulation of the tissues.
